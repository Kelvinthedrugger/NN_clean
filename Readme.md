A much more cleaner neural network from scratch using numpy, for practicing & mood changing

    python test.py

Best performance: 

 loss: 0.0434, accuracy: 0.9297

 time spent: 4.4415 sec (2 epochs)

 test accuracy: 0.9917

 test time: 0.0364 sec

# TODO

    add activation (matters for numerical stability): done

    add concat model feature (Adder in electronics) -> (fake) AutoML: tuning problem

    add convolution

    add LSTM -> add RL -> Real AutoML

    add model.save() method
