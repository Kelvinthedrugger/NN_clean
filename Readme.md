A much more cleaner neural network from scratch using numpy, for practicing & mood changing

    python test.py

Best performance: 

 loss: 0.0451 accuracy: 0.9230

 time spent: 4.5519 sec

 test accuracy: 0.9688

# TODO

    add activation (matters for numerical stability): done

    add concat model feature (Adder in electronics) -> (fake) AutoML: tuning problem

    add convolution

    add LSTM -> add RL -> Real AutoML

    add model.save() method
